### Projects
| Project Link | Project Description | Tools Used |
|---|---|---|
|ðŸš— [NYC Motor Vehicle Collision Analysis](https://github.com/darianlee444/Motor-Vehicle-Collision-Project)|This project analyzes NYC Motor Vehicle Collision Datasets sourced from NYPD accident reports. The purpose of this project is to address critical questions related to traffic safety in NYC by providing insights and, ultimately, enhancing traffic safety through data-backed recommendations for the city to prevent potential future collisions.|SQL, Power BI|
|:accessibility: [Human Resources Analysis](https://github.com/darianlee444/HR-Analytics-Project)|This project analyzes Human Resources Data from a fictional company. The goals of this project are to answer crucial questions using the Human Resources Data, provide deeper insights into employee patterns, and recommend changes based on the data to enhance diversity and success within this fictional company.|SQL, Power BI|
|âž• [Health and Wellness Analysis](https://github.com/darianlee444/Health-and-Wellness-Project)|This project analyzes Sleep Health and Lifestyle Data obtained from Kaggle involving fictional participants. The point of this project is to answer questions with regards to how the participants' health/wellness is affected by their sleep habits and lifestyle using insights from the data and then offer data-based recommendations on how these participants can improve their health.|SQL, Excel|
|ðŸ“ˆ [Simple Linear Regression Project](https://github.com/darianlee444/Simple-Linear-Regression-Project)|This project analyzes datasets with Independent Variable (IV) and Dependent Variable (DV) values sorted by ID and I made simple linear regression models based off these datasets. This project is broken into two parts (A and B), both with different purposes and data. The purpose of Part A is to be able to merge data sets, account for missing data, make an estimated simple linear regression model once the missing data is accounted for, and then analyze said modelâ€™s accuracy. The purpose of Part B was to analyze if different transformations of data were needed to achieve linearity for a regression model, and then analyze said modelâ€™s accuracy through a lack of fit test.|R|
|ðŸ“‰ [Multiple Linear Regression Project](https://github.com/darianlee444/Multiple-Linear-Regression-Project)|For this project, I was given a data file that contained 1335 observations of 25 variables. Of the 25 variables, one was a dependent variable (Y), and twenty-four were independent variables of which four were environmental variables (E1-E4) and twenty were genetic risk variables that were indicator variables with values of 0 and 1 (G1-G20). The goal of this project was to use the data given to find the original model that had been used to produce the data. This means finding out what independent variables significantly effect Y and what interactions between these independent variables significantly effect Y in order to build the final model that had produced this data. I then have to estimate the coefficients associated with said model and use them to make an estimate of said model.|R|
