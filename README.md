### Projects
| Project Link | Project Description | Tools Used |
|---|---|---|
|ðŸš— [NYC Motor Vehicle Collision Analysis](https://github.com/darianlee555/Motor-Vehicle-Collision-Project)|This project analyzes NYC Motor Vehicle Collision Datasets sourced from NYPD accident reports. The purpose of this project is to address critical questions related to traffic safety in NYC by providing insights and, ultimately, enhancing traffic safety through data-backed recommendations for the city to prevent potential future collisions.|SQL, Power BI|
|:accessibility: [Human Resources Analysis](https://github.com/darianlee555/HR-Analytics-Project)|This project analyzes Human Resources Data from a fictional company. The goals of this project are to answer crucial questions using the Human Resources Data, provide deeper insights into employee patterns, and recommend changes based on the data to enhance diversity and success within this fictional company.|SQL, Power BI|
|âž• [Health and Wellness Analysis](https://github.com/darianlee555/Health-and-Wellness-Project)|This project analyzes Sleep Health and Lifestyle Data obtained from Kaggle involving fictional participants. The point of this project is to answer questions with regards to how the participants' health/wellness is affected by their sleep habits and lifestyle using insights from the data and then offer data-based recommendations on how these participants can improve their health.|SQL, Excel|
|ðŸ“ˆ [Simple Linear Regression Project](https://github.com/darianlee555/Simple-Linear-Regression-Project)|This project analyzes datasets with Independent Variable (IV) and Dependent Variable (DV) values sorted by ID and I made simple linear regression models based off these datasets. This project is broken into two parts (A and B), both with different purposes. The purpose of Part A is to be able to merge data sets, account for missing data, make an estimated simple linear regression model once the missing data is accounted for, and then analyze said modelâ€™s accuracy. The purpose of Part B was to analyze if different transformations of data were needed to achieve linearity for a regression model, and then analyze said modelâ€™s accuracy through a lack of fit test.|R|
